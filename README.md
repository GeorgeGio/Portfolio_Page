# Profolio - George Oustapasidis  


## Description

In this project, our objective is to create personal portfolio that will showcase the work and projects that have been completed.

 To do this we created a page using HTML and CSS which also shows our knowledge and undrestanding of our abilities as a web developer. 

Profesionals within the tech industry consider the importance of having such live Portfolio as it gives a insight in a candidates ability.
