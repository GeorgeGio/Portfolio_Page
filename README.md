# Profolio - George Oustapasidis  


## Description

In this project, our objective is to create personal portfolio that will showcase the work and projects that have been completed.

 To do this we created a page using HTML and CSS which also shows our knowledge and undrestanding of our abilities as a web developer. 

Profesionals consider the importance of such process as it ensures that people with disabilities can access the given site, through the use of tech applications such as - screen readers.
